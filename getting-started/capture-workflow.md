## Capture Workflow

Put on the Pupil headset and plug it into your computer. Open the Pupil Capture app. You will be presented with 2 windows â€“ `World` and `Eye`.

Go through the following steps to get familiar with the Pupil workflow. You can also check out [video tutorials](#walkthrough-videos) at the end of the guide. 


### 1. Put on Pupil
Put on Pupil and plug it in. Headsets are adjustable and shipped with additional parts. For more information head over to the [Pupil Hardware](#pupil-hardware "pupil hardware") guide.

### 2. Start Pupil Capture

### 3. Intro to the UI
Below are the two main windows we will interface with throughout the application.

**World Window**
Let's get familiar with the `World` window.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pupil-labs/pupil/media/basic-workflow/world-callout.png" width="80%">
</p>

The `World` window is the main control center for `Pupil Capture`. It  displays a real-time video feed of your field of view (FOV), camera controls for the world view, controls for plugins like calibration, recording, streaming, and more.

  1. **Graphs** - this area contains performance graphs. You can monitor `CPU` and `FPS` as well as the `Confidence` of the pupil detection algorithm.  
  1. **Sidebar** - The main GUI for the `World` window is a sidebar. Click the `<|` icons to expand sidebar and sub-menus and  `|||` to collapse. The sidebar is scrollable. Plugins will launch new sub-menus in the sidebar.
  1. **Gaze dot** - the red dot shows where you are looking within the `world` FOV.
  1. **Hot keys** - this area contains clickable buttons for plugins. Letters correspond to keyboard shortcuts. Example: press the `C` key to start calibrating or press the `R` key to start/stop recording.

Let's take a closer look at the `General` sub-menu.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pupil-labs/pupil/media/basic-workflow/world-sidebar-callout.png" width="40%">
</p>

1. **Detection and mapping mode** - you can select `2d` or `3d` detection and mapping mode. We recommend 3d mode for almost all use cases.
1. **Detect eye0** and **Detect eye1** - these toggled buttons launch and stop eye processes in a new `Eye` window. All settings you make will be saved for the next time `Pupil Capture` is opened.
1. **Open plugin** - select a plugin from the drop down list. A plugin sub-menu will be added to the GUI with (optional) hot key. You can make your own plugins. Read more about that [here](#plugin-guide).



**Eye Window**

The `Eye` window displays a real-time video of your eye. You will primarily use the `Eye` window GUI to configure pupil detection algorithm parameters and eye camera settings.  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pupil-labs/pupil/media/basic-workflow/eye-callout.png" width="100%">

1. **Graph** - this area contains performance graphs. You can monitor `CPU` and `FPS`.
1. **Sidebar** - the main GUI for the `World` window is a sidebar. Click the `<|` icons to expand sidebar and sub-menus and  `|||` to collapse. The sidebar is scrollable. Plugins will launch new sub-menus in the sidebar.
1. **Pupil diameter** - Red circles are visualizations of `pupil min` and `pupil max` diameter. The Green circle is a visualization of the current apparent pupil diameter. Blue number in the center is the current apparent pupil diameter in pixels.

### 3. Check pupil detection
Take a look at the `Eye` window. If the pupil is detected you will see a red circle around the edge of your pupil and a red dot at the center of your pupil.

If the algorithm's detection confidence is high, the red circle will be opaque. If confidence diminishes the circle will become more transparent.

Try moving your head around a bit while looking at your eye to see that the pupil is robustly detected in various orientations.

<!--  
**Eye image mode**

There are three modes that you can select from the `General` menu: Camera Image, Region of Interest (ROI), and Algorithm. Here we will discuss Camera Image and Algorithm view mode.

  <th><p align='center'>Camera Image</p></th>

    </td>
    <td valign='top'>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Pupil detection algorithm settings**
Switch to `Algorithm` mode so that you can see a visualization of the pupil algorithm parameters set in the GUI.

<table>
  <p align="center"></p>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pupil-labs/pupil/media/basic-workflow/pupil-capture/eye-ui/pupil-detect-algor.png" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pupil-labs/pupil/media/basic-workflow/pupil-hardware/pupil-detection/pupil-algorithm.png" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

* In the `General` menu in the sidebar, switch the `Mode` to `Algorithm`
  * Scroll down to the `Pupil Detector 2D` submenu
  * Adjust `Pupil min` and `Pupil max` sliders.
  * Red circles in the bottom left visualize `Pupil min` and `Pupil max` values.
  * The green circle and value displayed at the center of the circles is the current pupil diameter. Make sure the green circle is within the two red circles.

### 4. Calibrate
In order to know what someone is looking at, we must to establish a mapping between pupil and gaze positions. This is what we call calibration.

The calibration process establishes a mapping from pupil to gaze coordinates. 

#### Screen Marker Calibration Method

> {{< lqip-img src="/images/pupil-capture/recording/record-callout.jpg" >}}

Click `c` on the world screen or press `c` on the keyboard to start calibrate.

> {{< lqip-img src="/images/pupil-capture/calibrate/calibrate-border.jpg" >}}

Follow the marker on the screen with your eyes and try to keep your head stationary

There are other calibration methods and lots more information how calibration works in the [user guide](#calibration "calibration").

### 5. Record

Start capturing data!

> {{< lqip-img src="/images/pupil-capture/recording/pupil-capture-v07-world-recording.jpg" >}}

Pupil Capture will save the world video stream and all corresponding gaze data in a folder in your user directory named `recordings`.

* Start recording: Press the `r` key on your keyboard or press the circular 'R' button in the left hand side of the world window.
* The elapsed recording time will appear next to the 'R' button.
* Stop recording: Press the `r` key on your keyboard or press the circular 'R' button in the left hand side of the world window.

See a video demonstration of how to set recordings path, session name, and start recording -- [here](http://youtu.be/VzIXFUqv99s).

#### Where is the recording saved?

By default, each recording will live in its own unique data folder contained in the `recordings` folder.

> {{< lqip-img src="/images/pupil-capture/recording/recording_folder_v07.jpg" >}}

You can make as many recordings as you like. 

The default `recordings` directory will have the following hierarchy.

* `recordings`
  * 2016-04-05
    * 001
    * 002
    * 003
    * ####

#### How recordings are saved?

Pupil capture saves the video frames in a fixed frame rate container. This means that the raw output video (world.mp4) does not show the correct duration and the correct frame rate of the recording. This information can be found in `world_timestamps.npy`, which tells you exactly where each frame belongs in time.

However, if you export using Pupil Player, the video will be made such that the frames will show at the exact right time. The output video will not miss any frame of the raw video, instead, output frames are spaced out exactly as they where initially captured.

<aside class="notice">
Note - The real FPS during recordings may fluctuate due variations on light intensity (LUX, lumens) and other issues; it cannot be forced to be constant.
