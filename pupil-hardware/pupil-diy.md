If you are an individual planning on using **Pupil** [exclusively for noncommercial purposes](#license), and are not afraid of SMD soldering and hacking -- then, buy the parts, modify the cameras, and assemble a Pupil DIY headset. We have made a [guide](#diy-kit-guide) to help you and a [shopping list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Al-zbr5hUFxPdEdJY1Z0dGRXU18yU0JxTVQ3THBOZFE&single=true&gid=0&output=html).
