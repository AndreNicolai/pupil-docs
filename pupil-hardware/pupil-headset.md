You wear Pupil like a pair of glasses. Pupil connects to a computing device via a USBA or USBC cable. The headset is designed to be lightweight and adjustable in order to accommodate a wide range of users. 

Above is an illustration of a monocular Pupil Headset, depending on your configuration, your headset might look different, but working principles are the same.

Pupil ships with a number of additional parts. The below sections provide an overview of their use and a guide to adjusting the Pupil headset.

  It is <strong>very important</strong> that your eye camera(s) are in focus. You will not achieve optimal eye tracking performance with poorly focused cameras. Pupil cameras are focused manually using the focus tool to twist the lens of the eye camera and adjusting the focal depth.
